### Description

Programming can be tough and sometimes it is hard to find a specific line of code that you need to get your application working. Our App, Snode, allows users to look at code snippets to quickly find code applicable to whatever application they are working on. They also have the ability to favorite code that is most helpful for them. This allows for the most appreciated code snippets to populate based off of popularity. 
   
   -Our app has a fast user interface.
    
   -Quickly find code that you are searching for.
    
   -Snippets are constantly being favorited by users for usefulness. 

   Please take a look at our free app and find that line of code that has been slowing you down.
